A LOT OF YOUR SONGS ARE ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO OTHER GIRLS WHO ARE GOING THROUGH HEARTBREAK?

Your feelings so are important to write down, to capture, and to remember because today you're heartbroken, but tomorrow you'll be in love again. And you'll appreciate it more when you can go back and read your journal and realize that the happiness you have is special because yesterday, you cried. I'm so lucky that I get to look at journals from when I was 13 and wanted [a singing career] so bad, but never thought that I would be able to have it, or to get to be on the cover of CosmoGirl.

SO YOU DIDN'T EXPECT SUCCESS?

No! The reason I was so driven was that I didn't expect that anything would just happen for me. But that doubt fueled me to work harder. My attitude was the opposite of people who are like, "It's gonna happen for me. It's gonna happen for me." My mantra was always, "It's not gonna happen for me. Go out and play that show or it won't happen." You know? I never expected anything to be given to me.

NOW THAT YOU'VE BECOME SO SUCCESSFUL, WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY?

What makes me happy is just curling up in with my mom in her bed and watching a marathon of CSI and Grey's Anatomy episodes with pints of ice cream. It's amazing when we get to do that. I think that what people always want is what they don't have a lot of, and the thing that I haven't had a lot of lately is getting to curl up in bed and watch a marathon of my favorite shows!

YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL DESERTED YOU ONE DAY. HOW DID THAT AFFECT THE PERSON YOU ARE NOW?

I think the tiniest little thing can change the course of your day, which can change the course of your year, which can change who you are. I'm not quite sure how it affected me to lose all my friends and have to walk into school and go at it alone, but I can only hope that it made me a stronger person. And I got to write songs about it â€” my first songs were written because of trying to deal with that emotion. I will never be able to thank those people enough because it's like, you can't write a song if you're not feeling anything, and sometimes, even though you have to be feeling pain, it's worth it in the end. But it's so funny because even when I go back to high school now, when I go back to functions like a football game or a band concert or something like that, it doesn't matter how many people come up and ask me for my autograph, if I see like one of those popular people, I still feel like my hair is frizzy and people are looking at me.

YOU'RE KNOWN FOR BEING CAREER-FOCUSED AND NOT PARTYING. DO YOU CONSCIOUSLY TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT SCENE?

No, I'm just being myself. I'm not a party girl at this point in my life. It's not a priority for me. I have to get up early and do interviews and I have to sing every night. I don't have any interest in going out to clubs right now. I love people, and I love socializing, I just don't have any interest in being drunk. I don't worry about [people who say I'm too much of a good girl] because the people who say that, it's like, wow, you are really trying to find something you don't like about me. And, honestly, if somebody wants to criticize me for not being a trainwreck, that's fine with me!
