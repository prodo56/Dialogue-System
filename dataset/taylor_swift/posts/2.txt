Say you’ll remember me.

You keep figuring out all the little clues and it makes me very proud.

I have a little surprise for you. The 1989 World Tour LIVE 
Directed by Jonas Akerlund
Released on @applemusic December 20, 2015


Today I begin my 26th year of freaking out over stuff.


Melbourne, the first two nights with you have been magical. Tonight we play this show for the very last time. I’m so honored I get to share the last night of the 1989 World Tour with all of you. This has been the most incredible adventure. Thank you for all of it.

Me acting all moody during Trouble but actually so happy because that Melbourne crowd was INCREDIBLE tonight.


OH MY GOD I MISS HER SO MUCH


Thanks for 2 incredible shows, Adelaide. It’s crazy to say this, but….
There is only one city left on the 1989 World Tour.
See you soon, Melbourne!💋


Yesterday was such an amazing day off– roller coasters, kangaroos and LOLs with @blakelively 🌷
See you tonight, Adelaide!

Me: Please love me.
Kangaroo: No.

I didn’t know ‘kangaroo selfies’ were a thing.
But they are and this is one.


Gorgeous crowd tonight in Brisbane!!


Brisbane ❤️


When the girls came over wearing beautiful beachy dresses they got at the gift shop, then said they got me one too. ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Swifts➕🐨
Thank you to the Australian Wildlife Conservancy for letting us hang out with Willy. WE LOVE HIM and will miss him terribly.


You can see it with the lights out.

Making friends on Hamilton Island


So stoked to be able to take my band and crew on a vacation at the end of a long and wonderful tour. For all their hard work this year, they really deserve it. Thank you to Hamilton Island for taking such great care of 125 of the people who work tirelessly to make sure the 1989 World Tour stage gets built, the lights are on, the costumes are made, the guitars are tuned, and the show goes on.
Aussie press, I love your enthusiasm but my birthday isn’t for 2 weeks and it’ll be a quiet one this year. Let’s take it down a notch:)

Swift family road trip!
South Island, NZ


I love you, Sydney. All 76,000 of you.


Olivia Benson chewing on Olivia Benson’s moon man because she is disrespectful.
So glad @therealmariskahargitay took it home and away from this monster.

Happy birthday to a mommy who lets her little girl dress like a princess whenever she wants, and makes balancing a million things look effortless and fun. 
I’m so glad you invited me to a Kings of Leon concert 6 years ago. 
My life would be unrecognizable without you, @lilyaldridge ❤️


Praying for Paris. Ours hearts are breaking for and with you.


Farewell, Shanghai!!


Bad blood/Mad love


All happy cause I got a new dress and also because Shanghai crowds are insane.


Taking in that beautiful Shanghai crowd with @gypsymoonshine @melanienyema @clareturtonderrico @eliottenicole

Great crowd last night in Singapore, see you again tonight guys 😘

After the costume change, while the crowd was singing.. Taking it all in with @idinamenzel


Frozen totally happened tonight. 
And 55,000 people sang ‘Let it Go’ so loudly, it nearly took my breath away. 
Good times, @idinamenzel ☃

Getting to share the stage with @alessiasmusic during ‘Here’. Honestly couldn’t be more impressed by this girl.


With every passing day, Olivia looks less like a cat and more like a melting snowman.
Happy #NationalCatDay 🐱⛄️


Happy #NationalCatDay from Olivia who, with every passing day, looks less like a cat and more like a melting snowman.

Thank you @dwyanewade for giving me a 13 jersey and for welcoming us to Miami 1️⃣3️⃣ What an incredible evening, spent with incredible people.


Hugging it out after the crowd screamed louder than I thought was humanly possible for @dwyanewade!!

That crowd went CRAZY when @pitbull walked out! We sang ‘Give Me Everything’. So much fun.

I had the best time with you @ricky_martin!! Thank you for making #1989TourMiami unforgettable!

I saw that dog in the front row and did not, for one second, feel that there was anything out of place.

Just casually watching Fixer Upper when this iconic moment happened.

Indianapolis, you looked awesome tonight.


Tonight in Indianapolis, @thebandperry surprised the crowd and everyone sang ‘If I Die Young’ SO LOUD. Such a fun show!!
