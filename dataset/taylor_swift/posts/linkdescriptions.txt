Former Hippos singer Ariel Rechtschaid has produced the upcoming Taylor Swift and Kanye West collaboration ‘Bad Blood’. 
The celebrity duo recorded the new version of the song together in recent weeks following the Grammy Awards. The original version appears on Swift’s ‘1989’ album.

Okay, I FINALLY managed to get this up, I’m with my friends Ella and Ceri and obviously Holly (@wildestswxfts). For some reason I chose the two most excitable of my friends to open this with me and Holly, so I would not recommend watching this with headphones because the screams will blow your head off. 

Taylor, thank you SO MUCH. I love you a lot as you might be able to tell from this video and I am so grateful for the amount of effort put into this package, I adore all of it. I apologise for the amount of cutting of clips, it had to be less than 15 minutes so I had to cut a lot out. Also, there were loads of spaces of time filled by me just crying into my hands in disbelief, and they made the video really long… I’m also sorry its so long and my camera women aren’t great… I hope you enjoy watching us try to stay alive and handle the loss of chill. I LAV YA TAY-LAH, I can just hope that one day I’ll get to thank you in person and give you a massive hug.

This video is set as “unlisted” meaning you can only reach it with the link, it wont come up if you type the title into youtube (i THINK that’s what unlisted means)

I AM SOBBING LITERALLY SOBBING

<blockquote><p>Taylor,</p>

<p>I can’t quite believe what has just happened. In fact, I feel that I wasn’t portraying how truly excited I am because I was in such a state of shock. You have been so unbelievably kind and generous.</p>

<p>I am literally speechless, I will never be able to thank you enough because what you have done is so overwhelmingly sweet. As I said, you honestly have a heart a pure gold. I love you.</p>

<p>Your valentine,<br/>

<div>Once upon a time way back in 2006 I had a life-changing experience. Though I didn’t know it then, it’s brought me to where I am right now: sitting in bed wearing pajamas that Taylor Swift bought me for Christmas and posting on Tumblr about what I just ate for dinner. Flash forward to right now - I’m a journalism major interning at the Houston Chronicle. Despite being in constant defense mode, we’ve established so many jokes and relationships all because of Taylor. A few weeks later after the release of her latest album, “1989,” I was feeling spontaneous and decided to film myself driving around Houston dancing and singing ridiculously to the album while in my car. […] she actually saw it, and if you follow Taylor on Twitter you might recognize the following tweet: And now Amber will demonstrate the correct way to listen to 1989 in an automobile. Two and a half weeks later, an amazing thing happened that I still can’t wrap my mind around. Taylor mailed me a box filled with Christmas presents. Each gift was individually wrapped with a personalized note attached, and she even included a beautiful card. […] Taylor will demonstrate the correct way to be famous and still appreciative of every single one of her fans.</div>
