Happy birthday, you precious little angel, Camila Cabello!! 💕💕💕
Senior year.
Freshmen year.
I met her when I was 10 days old, and him in kindergarten. Now they&rsquo;re married and I&rsquo;m the happiest maid of honor ever. Congratulations @britmaack and Ben!
Looking back on the highlights of my life, there&rsquo;s a moment I&rsquo;ll never forget from a day in London about two years ago. I was in town to play the O2 and I was out shopping on my day off. My friend Ed Sheeran met up with me in this little shop where I was buying ballet shoes. He walks in and says &ldquo;you have to hear this new song. I think it&rsquo;s the best one I&rsquo;ve ever written.&rdquo; And then, as usual, he pulls out his phone and gives me headphones. I sat there on a bench in that store and heard &lsquo;Thinking Out Loud&rsquo; for the first time, as little kids were picking out tutus and leotards next to us. Little did we know it would go on to be first dance song at countless weddings all over the world, become Ed&rsquo;s biggest hit, and eventually go on to win him Song of the Year at the 2016 Grammys. Ed and I had been on tour together all year on the Red Tour and we saw each other almost every day. I lived for the moments he would burst into my dressing room with a new song to play me. It happened so often that it became normal, and I don&rsquo;t think he ever knew how much it meant to me that he wanted me to hear his songs first. I don&rsquo;t think he ever knew how inspired I was by his drive and passion to constantly create new art. But it&rsquo;s his 25th birthday today, so I&rsquo;m saying it now. You deserve everything you have, and everything you will continue to achieve, Ed.

And an extra congratulations to the incredible Amy Wadge for your two Grammys.

Today I begin my 26th year of freaking out over stuff.
Melbourne, the first two nights with you have been magical. Tonight we play this show for the very last time. I&rsquo;m so honored I get to share the last night of the 1989 World Tour with all of you. This has been the most incredible adventure. Thank you for all of it.
Me acting all moody during Trouble but actually so happy because that Melbourne crowd was INCREDIBLE tonight.
OH MY GOD I MISS HER SO MUCH
Thanks for 2 incredible shows, Adelaide. It&rsquo;s crazy to say this, but&hellip;. 
There is only one city left on the 1989 World Tour. 
See you soon, Melbourne!💋
Yesterday was such an amazing day off&ndash; roller coasters, kangaroos and LOLs with @blakelively 🌷 
See you tonight, Adelaide!
Me: Please love me. 
Kangaroo: No.
I didn&rsquo;t know &lsquo;kangaroo selfies&rsquo; were a thing.

Making friends on Hamilton Island
So stoked to be able to take my band and crew on a vacation at the end of a long and wonderful tour. For all their hard work this year, they really deserve it. Thank you to Hamilton Island for taking such great care of 125 of the people who work tirelessly to make sure the 1989 World Tour stage gets built, the lights are on, the costumes are made, the guitars are tuned, and the show goes on. 

Aussie press, I love your enthusiasm but my birthday isn&rsquo;t for 2 weeks and it&rsquo;ll be a quiet one this year. Let&rsquo;s take it down a notch:)

I&rsquo;m so glad you invited me to a Kings of Leon concert 6 years ago.

@misterryanadams


when my mom won’t let me buy a 12th copy of 1989.

When I go on Tumblr and Taylor’s just left.

When you follow the instructions but you actually don’t get the girl.

all of the above

when you give all your love to a boy who changes his mind

When your parents won’t let you go to the concert 13 hours early

When the fella over there doesn’t have hella good hair

when you can’t see it with the lights out

When your parents don’t let you buy more Taylor Swift merch

When you don’t feel it on the way home 

When you can’t hear it in the silence

when he doesnt remember you standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset 

When he doesnt have that james dean daydream look in his eye

WHEN YOU ARENT WELCOMED IN NEW YORK


When he has a blank space but he doesn’t write your name


When you find wonderland but you don’t get lost in it


When you don’t see sparks fly whenever he smiles

When you can’t build a castle out of bricks they threw at you

When you aren’t out of the woods yet

When this love doesn’t come back to you

When you can’t find wonderland

When he doesn’t see that you’re the one who understands him

When he doesn’t think you belong with him 

*when I don&rsquo;t know places we can hide* *when he doesn&rsquo;t see me in hindsight* *when these hands had to let it go free but this love did not come back to me* *when we go out of style* *when looking at it now, it all does not seem so simple* *when your mom yells at you to put some damn clothes on when you are quite clearly dressed because robes are clothes* *NO WHALE Well that escalated quickly.
Indianapolis, you looked awesome tonight.
Tonight in Indianapolis, @thebandperry surprised the crowd and everyone sang &lsquo;If I Die Young&rsquo; SO LOUD. Such a fun show!!

The screams you hear from an LA crowd when Kobe walks out onstage are so deafening you think you may have permanent hearing loss. But it was SO WORTH IT.
Getting ready to play 5 shows at Staples Center in LA this week and reminiscing about what my gigs used to be like.
For those of you who have fallen in love with &lsquo;Skittles Guy&rsquo; because of the video of a man passionately selling Skittles before my show on the Red Tour, I got to meet him tonight. His name is Derrick and he knows you guys are obsessed with him. He sells lemonade now and comes up with rhymes to sell it and just generally delights people in the crowd. I was really excited to meet someone who puts such personal flare into his job. Tonight&rsquo;s crowd was unreal and I love you guys so much.




The way Ed just turns around like “what the hell are you doing Taylor&quot; 
But seriously Taylor… what do you call this dance move? 

Taylor this is so important, we need a name for this move


The Mom-Croon - (noun) A dance move invented at the 2014 Grammy Awards. To sway, perform, and sing along to a song in an extremely emotional or sentimental way, possibly incorporating hand gestures. Eyes closed, lost in the music. The way your mom gets taken away by a tune from her high school days, glass of red wine in hand, shuffling around the room as her teenage kids roll their eyes in disdain. Cynics may judge the Mom-Crooners (MC&rsquo;s as they are commonly referred to in the dance world) as it is a form of dance only perfected by those willing to be absolutely swept away by the feels you get when you hear a certain song. Those who know how to Mom Croon cannot see the eye rolls of haters. They have reached a level of musical transcendence that is hater-proof. Once you perfect the mom croon, you are truly free. Used in a sentence: &ldquo;Oh look, Taylor&rsquo;s being embarrassing again&ndash; just mom-crooning away in the corner by herself because Sometimes by Britney Spears came on. Oh God. Now she&rsquo;s crying.&rdquo;

What is Taylor doing??? 😆😆😆

This was backstage at Hyde Park! We didn&rsquo;t have a sound check to walk them through their blocking, so I made a map of the stage with paper on the floor and demonstrated where they would be walking out using nail polish to represent each girl.As you do.
Happy birthday to cheeky, charming @Caradelevingne- who lights up my life..and regularly steals my phone &amp; does this:
You seem stressed.
Can&rsquo;t even describe how happy I was when this was taken.  
Thank you again @Ciara for being so magical.
Unable to find my chill because of @fettywap1738 singing &lsquo;Trap Queen&rsquo; for 60,000 people in Seattle. Amazing night!!
That Seattle crowd went ABSOLUTELY INSANE when @ciara and @dangerusswilson walked out!! I LOVED TONIGHT
@mariotestino took this picture of me. I like it because I appear to be upset about having been woken up from a nap I was taking in my feather nest, and that is a unique kind of mood to capture.
Thanks Edmonton&ndash; tonight was insanely fun and I can&rsquo;t wait to be back on your stage tomorrow night!

So prom is on Thursday and I need to know, tie or bow tie?

I like the tie but honestly both are great. I just feel like you look like a 50&rsquo;s movie star in the bow tie, but more like a modern movie star in the tie. Depends on what vibe you&rsquo;re wanting to convey but I&rsquo;d say the tie. Great suit btw!

hey tay! i’m not usually one for posts like this, but i have something i need to share with you.

you’ve seen a few of my posts before, but this is something that i’ve never shared with you… or anybody for the most part. i want to let you know that i was born with a congenital heart defect, and as a result i’ve had holes and leaks in two of the valves in my heart. i’ve had surgery twice and because of this my heart is mainly ((hence the word “mainly”)) hole free! however, ever since i actually could comprehend that there was something wrong with me, i never truly understood why i deserved to have a severe and life threatening condition anyway

in light of all my confusion, i’ve found someone whose made all of these blurry lines become clear and i want to thank you for that.. taylor, you’ve made each and every long hospital visit, echo, ekg, iv, etc., easier, and i am so so incredibly grateful for that. you allowed me to be accepting towards the condition that i have and i’m so unbelievably thankful for that… love you always, emily. taylorswift

Hey Emily, This was beautiful. I can&rsquo;t imagine what it must have been like to have to undergo huge surgeries like that, and the fear and stress that came along with them. Then you heal and have to live in constant fear that something might happen or you might work your heart too hard&hellip; I think it&rsquo;s amazing that you&rsquo;re so honest about how it&rsquo;s affected you. It&rsquo;s impossible to be positive all the time about something that completely terrifies and confuses you, and I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re not putting that kind of weird pressure on yourself. Thanks for listening to my music to escape from your fears and to confront them. I really appreciate you writing this. Sending you the biggest hug from my hotel room, where I&rsquo;ve just raided the snack bar and eaten everything in the style of a raccoon rummaging through a trash can.

uh, taylor there’s supposed to an apostrophe s on its btw taylorswift 



The apostrophe blended into the Y above it. But if we&rsquo;re being all fancy with grammar tonight, btw would&rsquo;ve had a comma before it. And the &lsquo;U&rsquo; is 'uh&rsquo; would&rsquo;ve been capitalized. And there would&rsquo;ve been some sort of punctuation at the end of the sentence.SEE IT DOESN&rsquo;T FEEL NICE DOES IT SO LET&rsquo;S STOP THIS MADNESS*My lack of punctuation there was intentional, ironic, and for comedic purposes. I&rsquo;m also joking about being mad. :)

I posted some of these a while ago saying that my grandma in the 50s was taylor. I visited her today (see the pictures of her avoiding my selfies) and she told me stories. my grandpa (the guy in the pictures with her) and her were high school sweethearts, and he broke up with her a couple times to date other girls. she told me that once when they broke up she burned his picture and wrote songs about it. my grandma in the 50s was LITERALLY taylor.

Dear Taylor, 
It’s me, iced coffee girl, and I could really use a hug. Today is Mother’s Day, a day most people spend with their mothers thanking them for everything they do. But, for me, I can’t spend this day with my mom because she’s in heaven. Last January, my mom passed away and a piece of my heart left with her. My mom was my best friend, the one I laughed with, the one I cried with, and the one I loved with my whole heart. For a while, I felt empty. But as you’ve done many times before, you filled that hole. You took me out of my sad place and made me happy. And because of you, I got through something that was the hardest thing in the world for me. Today’s going to be another hard day, but I know with you on my side I can get through anything. I love you. Always, Kaileen


Kaileen- I love you so much and can&rsquo;t imagine what you must be feeling today. You&rsquo;ve lived through my worst fear. I&rsquo;m so sorry you can&rsquo;t spend today with her. It&rsquo;s not fair, and there&rsquo;s no reason why you should feel okay about it. No one should ever expect you to feel normal today. I admire and respect your ability to put forth such a sunny, sweet disposition when you&rsquo;ve been through something so dark and tragic so recently. I never would&rsquo;ve guessed by your attitude or your posts. I never would&rsquo;ve known if you hadn&rsquo;t told me. Sending you a huge hug today.  Gonna go get iced coffee and cheers to you. :)

TAYLOR look at this cat, who is very small at the moment. taylorswift

I can sense you thinking about getting a third cat taylorswift

I know you want it taylorswift

Christopher thank you for showing me pictures of a tiny baby cat when you know I&rsquo;m still reeling from Derek&rsquo;s tragic and unspeakable death. You knew that some wounds can only be soothed by pictures of newborn kittens, and for that I am feeling all the feels.   But no, I can&rsquo;t say I want a third cat on here cause then US Weekly will call me a cat lady again.

lol I thought that was 2 of me.


AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I need one for Dibbles that says &lsquo;I kept trying to eat the fresh flowers in the house so mom had to stop buying them. Now I keep trying to eat the wallpaper because it has flowers printed on it. Mom doesn&rsquo;t know quite how to handle the situation.&rsquo;

It&rsquo;s not about having the coolest friends or the most friends, it&rsquo;s about having the right friends. True friends. Realizing that is one of the most important lessons I&rsquo;ve ever learned. I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re making good grades!! Living your life to make the people you love proud is a beautiful thing, and I think it&rsquo;s really wonderful that you consider me one of those people. Thank you. You DO make me proud and I&rsquo;m thinking of you on your birthday. See you in JUNE!!!









Love, A Swiftie
Caillou Pettis



@taylorswift Please look at this! &lt;3



Caillou- Hi pal.  I was really shocked to hear you say that you&rsquo;d been bullied because of your name because the first thing I thought when I saw it was &lsquo;woah, Caillou is such a cool name&rsquo;. Honestly. I thought it was so cool because it&rsquo;s different, and herein lies our issue: you will always be criticized and teased and bullied for things that make you different, but usually those things will be what set you apart. The things that set you apart from the pack, the things that you once thought were your weaknesses will someday become your strengths. So if they say you&rsquo;re weird or annoying or strange or too this or not enough that, maybe it&rsquo;s because you threaten them. Maybe you threaten them because you&rsquo;re not the norm. And if you&rsquo;re not the norm, give yourself a standing ovation.  Now I want to tell you that I think you look great the way you are. No one has the right to criticize you for how your body looks, but they will. One thing I&rsquo;ve learned from experiencing this exact kind of criticism is that no one else can label your body except for you. No one gets to have a place in your mind if they weren&rsquo;t invited there by you. So please do me this one favor: Don&rsquo;t let their ugly words into your beautiful mind. And if someone punches you again, call the police and report them because that is assault. I&rsquo;m serious. There&rsquo;s no direct penalty for bullying with words (except karma) but no one is allowed to hit you. Ever. Thanks for telling me your story and for being so strong.  Proud of you, Caillou Pettis.

spent 12/13/14, aka  taylorswift &rsquo;s 25th birthday, at the grammy museum&rsquo;s opening of the taylor swift experience exhibit with two amazing friends I met at the LA secret sessions (nava / cest-le-real-leal ) and we all signed her birthday card and ate cupcakes and danced hard to shake it off and cried over wallpaper, outfits, baby pictures, and the overall amazing was and flawlessness and magicalness that is taylor! i am so honored to have gotten to celebrate with you in some form!

i hope you actually see this card bc they said you would but idk idk and anyways it was amazing being able to scream and cry about your baby pictures and clothes with others who understood taylorswift  so once again THANK YOU for bringing amazing people into my life

You&rsquo;re amazing!! I love seeing your smiling faces. Thanks for going to see the exhibit, I&rsquo;m going to go see it soon too. I hope you had a great day!

There are SO many reasons why this is the cutest photo of all time.
The only known photo of tellyouiminsane and me, as we are quite elusive and super private about our friendship.
A rare photo of me and lanternsburning in our natural habitat.

 taylorswift i love you



Back then, I felt the same way about those arm warmers as torturedloves felt about ponchos.

&ldquo;SUP GUYS I HAVE ARRIVED CHECK OUT MY SWEET ARM WARMERS.&rdquo;
It takes a while to actually comprehend something like this. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite covers and stories. A huge thank you to Time Magazine and to Jack Dickey for writing such an eloquently worded piece. 
PS WHAT IS LIFE RIGHT NOW.




omg taylor i love you so much

Leaving her apartment | New York City, NY | November 12, 2014

Taylor wears a 525 America sweater while leaving her apartment last night — en route to a Knicks game! Her bordeaux sweater here is actually a reversible piece with Taylor opting to wear the neck cut out side for the front and the high-neck turtleneck to the back. 

I think what they&rsquo;re trying to say politely is&hellip; I wore the shirt wrong didn&rsquo;t I.




I AM NOT ALIVE. Let the gross sobbing begin. Thank thank thank you Taylor for visiting Leyton. I can’t even put into words how amazing you are and can never repay you. Leyton will remember this and his awesome gifts forever. We all love you so much and I’m so glad he thanked you with this epic kiss.

oh my GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING

It was the best way to spend the 13th:) Love you guys.


Natalie is back.


This is incredible.
Knicks.


WHEN TAYLOR SWIFT HOOKS YOU THE FUCK UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I used to work at tim hortons and the baker used to make me magical creations like this donut completely covered in sprinkles.
I know you want dis taylorswift

WANT WANT WANT  NEED.It&rsquo;s the perfect pastry, and I don&rsquo;t know where I can find it. More importantly I can&rsquo;t figure out how to get it now, without getting out of bed.This was cruel, Julii. And yet I am impressed and intrigued.


Chasing Taylor through the blank space experience like

Oh my God, Nay-Nay.Your pics have been so absurd lately and I completely approve.
I could show you incredible things.

Hey taylorswift  I’m Sarah, and I’m definitely not the most vocal fan out there (although I’m working on it!) but it doesn’t mean that I love you any less. I’m thankful to say that I haven’t had a horrible life so far; your music hasn’t had to save my life, or get me through any kind of depression. Instead, I always wanted a sister, and its corny and maybe a little weird, but in a way you’ve always felt like a big sister to me, and that’s how you’ve helped me. We’ve never met, but if I needed advice or reassurance I’d go to your music and it would tell me what to do, or how to manage. There has been countless situations when I’ve needed self confidence or guidance, and it has always helped. So basically, I just want to thank you for the beautiful gift of your music, of your relatable lyrics, of your big-sister persona, of your kindness. I’m lucky to have a wonderful wonderful family and amazing friends, but I’d be nowhere near the person I am today without your influence, so thank you thank you thank you. I love you so much &lt;3

please love me taylorswift 





I definitely do love you. Thank you so much for that note, it was so heartfelt and charming. I hope we cross paths soon:)

MMMKAY&ndash; there are two ways you can go about this.  The quick and easy way is to make sugar cookies from a sugar cookie mix and just cut open a packet of chai tea and pour it into the batter as you make it. Cause you&rsquo;re busy and you want making cookies to be a chill part of your day. Pow. Done.ORIf you want to make the cookies from scratch (that&rsquo;s what I did for the 1989 Secret Sessions), you can use this recipe I found on a baking blog I like, joythebaker.com and I believe it was originally from a book called The Pastry Queen. If you want another great baking blog, I get a lot of great ideas from smittenkitchen.com too. This is a recipe for basic insanely good sugar cookies. I added the chai element to the recipe because I thought it would infuse cozy holiday vibez into the cookie and it really did. So I&rsquo;ll star the part that I added in the recipe. http://joythebaker.com/2009/06/giant-vanilla-sugar-cookies/ ***after you add the egg and vanilla, cut one chai tea packet open and empty the crushed up tea leaves into the batter CAUSE CHAI COOKIES ARE ABOUT TO HAPPEN UP IN HERE*** I made an icing for the cookies, but they&rsquo;re fine on their own. If you want to make icing for them, just mix 1 cup powdered sugar with &frac14; T-spoon of nutmeg, &frac14; T-spoon of cinnamon and 3 TAYblespoons &lt;&mdash;(I&rsquo;m so annoying, it astounds me sometimes) of milk or eggnog if you can find it this time of year. The more milk/eggnog you add, the more your icing will become a glaze. But glazes are legit too so basically just LIVE YOUR LIFE. I lightly sprinkled cinnamon over the icing once the cookies were baked and iced, but there are so many icing options you can pair with these cookies&ndash;I mean it&rsquo;s out of control.  If you&rsquo;re really feeling like living on the edge, you can go ahead and add a few drops of food coloring to the icing to make it festive. No one is going to stop you. Why?Cause the bakers gonna bake bake bake bake bake.Bye.
